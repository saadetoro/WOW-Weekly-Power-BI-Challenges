*Create a report view that allows users to toggle between the metrics Total Revenues, Total Expenses, and Total Profits. 
*Create a Measures Table that lets you reference these values using the SWITCH() function, which you must use. 
*Use a horizontal slicer to allow you to toggle between the metrics
*Make sure users aren’t able to see all three metrics at once – we want users to be able to focus on one metrics at a time. 
*Formatting is totally up to you! We’ve been loving the creativity that the #WOW2021 community has been producing – keep it coming!
